# Salmon cooki-shack

Week 2 project of 201. More styling and a little more of everything.

## The mission

This project called for making a website for an imaginary coookie-shop owner. 
It called for at least two html files, one for a costumer-facing website and one for just the staff. The one for the staff includes calculatons for sales, and a form to enter new locations if needed.

## Build status

It is done on the 7th day of the project, with some nice extras.
